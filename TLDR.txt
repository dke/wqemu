After booting some manual commands are required (could be put in some automated
startup script perhaps), see boot.sh.

After powersame, the bridge seems to lose the ip and its clients, so some other
stuff is required, no clue how that could be automized, see wakeup.sh.

For a documentation about the script itself, see its included usage
information.

Assumptions in the scripts:

bridge network: 172.16.0.0/16
infrastructure range: 172.16.0.0/24
dhcp range: 172.16.1.0/24
reservations: 172.16.2.0/24
